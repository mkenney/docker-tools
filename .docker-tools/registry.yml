  notes: |-
    A yarn command that writes files as the current user running on Node 7.0. And a long note. Like really long. Really really long. So long I don't know what else to say. I mean, how much can you say about a long note. It's just a bunch of stupid text.
    And now, I've gone and put a new line. And now, I'm going to put a blank line!

    There it went! Hope it worked.
